JavaScript Fundamentals
This repository contains exercises and projects demonstrating fundamental concepts in JavaScript. It's designed to help beginners solidify their understanding and build a strong foundation.

Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile and powerful scripting language primarily used for web development. This repository provides a structured approach to learning its core elements. Each section includes explanations and practical examples.

Data Types
This section covers the fundamental data types in JavaScript:
//Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
//String: Represents textual data.
//Boolean: Represents true or false values.
//Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
//Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
//Symbol (ES6): Represents a unique and immutable value.

Operators
This section explores various JavaScript operators:
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=
Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

Control Flow
This section demonstrates control flow statements:
if statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
else if statement: Provides additional conditions to check.
else statement: Executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.
switch statement: Provides an alternative to if-else if-else for multiple conditions.
for loop: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
do-while loop: Similar to while, but executes the code block at least once.
